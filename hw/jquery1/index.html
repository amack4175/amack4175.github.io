      <p>1. For this step, all that is needed to do is place one foot slightly in front of the other, depending on what hand you are shooting the basketball with. If you are a right handed shooter, place the right foot slightly in front of your left. If you shoot the ball with your left hand, place left foot slightly in front of the right foot.</p>

      <p>2. This next step for shooting a basketball is pretty simple. Most people get this right when picking up a basketball. For right handed players, your right hand, or shooting hand, will be placed directly at the center of the basketball with your fingers spread evenly. This hand will actually follow through and shoot the basketball. The left hand for right handed players would be the guide hand that is placed on the side of the ball to keep everything balanced. Everything is opposite for left handed shooters.</p>

      <p>3. When you are ready to actually take a shot, the first move with your body that you should make is downward toward the ground by loading the knees, quads, and most leg muscles. </p>

      <p>4. Once your back is straight and you are in the process of jumping up into the air, your arms should rise with the ball in front of your face or slightly to the right if you are a right handed player and prepare to take off using that momentum that was generated with your legs in the previous step. </p>

      <p>5. Once a person snaps his or her wrist and ball is shot, hold your hand down in a bent wrist position unitl the ball hits the ground. People use the comparison of reaching up on top of the refrigerator to demonstrate and picture how the follow through should look.</p>
