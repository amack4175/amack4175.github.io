  <h2 class="secondarycolor coiny mediumtext">Student Athlete</h2>
  <p id="" class="william">I was born in Las Vegas, Nevada. I attend the University of Miami as a student-athelte. I am majoring in communications and minoring in business marketing. I was All-Mid-Atlantic Prep League and All-State selection as a senior at Blair Academy in Blairstown, N.J. I was ranked the 51st shooting guard in my recruiting class. I started on varsity at Catholic Central High School in eighth grade and left as programâ€™s leading scorer with 1,557 points before transferring to Blair. I also played AAU basketball for South Jersey Jazz and was coached by former NBA player and ESPN analyst Tim Legler. I played for Joe Mantengna at Blair Academy and before choosing Miami, I also received offers from Villanova, Memphis, Georgia, Missouri and Saint Louis, and more.</p>

  <p>Throughout high school I had a grade point average (gpa) of 3.6. At the University of Wyoming I had a 3.2 gpa. Now at the University of Miami, I am on the honor roll with a 3.4 gpa.
